		"about": {
			"p1": "I discovered ceramics when I was twenty. It is a beautiful craft that drew me in at a time when I was searching for my place in the world. In small Prague workshops, I learned to work on the potter's wheel. I was lucky to have excellent teachers, to whom I owe what I know today. Working with wet clay sparkles my imagination and love for nature.",
			"p2": "Fire clay, even though it is specially prepared for modelling, shaping, and firing at high temperatures, still remains a piece of earth – a natural material I have never stopped learning to understand and work with. It is an endless journey of mutual discovery and growth. A constant exploration of new ways to work with this beautiful and malleable material."

		"spiral": {
			"title": "Spiral",
			"p1": "As a decorative element, I often use the meander – a spiral shape symbolizing the flow of life, natural rhythms, the energy of the female cycle, and the changing seasons.",
			"p2": "Much of my work consists of everyday-use vessels, which I create on the potter’s wheel. I glaze them with matte glazes or leave their surfaces unglazed – as their texture most resembles the living nature.",
			"p3": "Recently, I have also been inspired by ancient rustic pottery, glazing with a semi-matte brown glaze and decorating with simple stamping."
